## Passion

I used to work in Sable team in Amazon, which is the largest nosql database cluster in the world that supports almost 100 million tps, backing the Amazon website. The operation work is so heavy that we have to delegate part of it to a team in India.

Usually, when you get paged for a ticket, you need to look at the metrics to determine what kind of problem it is, where the problem is, then try to mitigate the problem following by root causing the problem, and fix it if possible. If a human being could determine the root cause of the problem , why cann't an AI do it for us?

## Design

* Inputs: graphs and metrics
* Outputs: possible problem type, problem location, suggested solutions

## Components

* Data Collector
